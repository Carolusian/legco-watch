published the White Paper on “The Practice of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region” (“White Paper”).  Section 3 in Part V of the White Paper points out that “Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong” means that “Hong Kong must be governed by the Hong Kong people with patriots as the mainstay”, and those who administrate Hong Kong (including judges of the courts at different levels and other judicial personnel) “have on their shoulders the responsibility of correctly understanding and implementing the Basic Law, of safeguarding the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and of ensuring the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong” (“political requirements”).  Subsequently, the Secretary for Justice told the media that “as judges have to swear in when assuming office, this is already a manifestation of ‘loving the country and Hong Kong’ from a legal perspective”.  However, the judicial oath to be taken by judges upon assumption of office does not include the political requirements mentioned in the White Paper.  In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(1)<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>whether the existing political system in Hong Kong requires judges and other judicial personnel to love the country and Hong Kong; whether it has examined how the requirement for such personnel to love the country and Hong Kong manifests from a legal prospective, including what other requirements such personnel must comply with, apart from swearing in pursuant to Article 104 of the Basic Law when assuming office;</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(2)<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>whether it has examined the impacts of the aforesaid political requirements for judges and other judicial personnel, as put forward in the White Paper, on their discharge of official duties; whether they are required, in handling cases, to consider how to comply with such political requirements; and</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(3)<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>if it has examined where judges, in presiding over cases, have arrived at contradictory conclusions by interpreting the law according to the common law principles and by considering how to comply with the political requirements, whether they should deliver judgments on the basis of the former or the latter; whether judges are required to bear any consequence when their judgments delivered in accordance with the common law principles are regarded by the Central Government as jeopardizing the country’s sovereignty, security or development interests?</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:14.36em">Public Officer to reply<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>:<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span><strong>The Secretary for Justice</strong></span></p><p><span style="margin-left:-0.49em"><strong>2.</strong><strong><span class="pydocx-tab"> </span></strong><strong>Hon Alice MAK</strong><strong> to ask:</strong> <span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>(Translation)</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:2.01em">The Government announced on the 3rd of last month the establishment of a Task Force on Promotion of Vocational Education (“Task Force”) with immediate effect.

In this connection, will the Government inform this Council whether it will, by making reference to the arrangements made between 1990 and 1999 when the New Airport and Related Projects were being carried out, consider afresh the introduction of a special labour importation scheme for public housing and infrastructure works projects, so as to ensure that such works projects will be completed on schedule, thereby addressing the housing needs of the grassroots as early as possible and maintaining sustained development of Hong Kong’s economy; if the Government will not consider introducing such a scheme, of the specific reasons for that, and whether it has assessed the specific impacts of labour shortage on such works projects?</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:14.36em">Public Officers to reply<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>:<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span><strong>Secretary for Development</strong></span></p><p><span style="margin-left:14.36em"><strong><span class="pydocx-tab"> </span></strong><strong><span class="pydocx-tab"> </span></strong><strong>Secretary for </strong><strong>Labour</strong><strong> and Welfare</strong></span></p><p><span style="margin-left:-0.49em"><strong>4.</strong><strong><span class="pydocx-tab"> </span></strong><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Hon Elizabeth QUAT</strong><strong> to ask:</strong><strong> </strong><span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>(Translation)</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:2.00em">The Airport Authority (“AA”) has recently released an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) Report on Expansion of the Hong Kong International Airport (“HKIA”) into a Three-Runway System (“3RS”).  The EIA Report contains the results of a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of the expansion project and the future operation of the 3RS in 12 different aspects, such as air quality, aircraft noise, marine ecology, the fisheries industry and human health, etc. and it recommends the adoption of more than 250 mitigation measures.

Nevertheless, quite a number of such people in need have relayed to me that such barrier-free facilities are still very inadequate, making it inconvenient for PWD to use public transport services.

As such, it is estimated that the fees and charges charged by MPF trustees and fund managers are as high as $9.2 billion per annum.  The press report has cited an example of an employee and his employer making monthly contributions to an MPF scheme for 40 years, and it turns out that the fund management fees will account for as much as 39% to 52% of the employee’s accrued benefits.  The press report has also pointed out that four trustees are currently having a total market share of as high as 70% in the MPF market, thereby creating a quasi-monopolistic market situation, which is the main reason why the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (“MPFA”) has been ineffective in pushing forward a reduction of the MPF fund management fees.  The public’s lukewarm response to the “MPF Semi-Portability” (i.e. the “Employee Choice Arrangement”) is also related to the trustees’ refusal to enhance their efficiency and their levying of additional fees and charges.  In addition, some members of the public have relayed that MPFA has, on the one hand, requested the trustees to lower their fund management fees with a view to reducing MPF expenses, and on the other hand, it uses public funds to rent office accommodation at high rentals and employ many staff members with high salaries.  Regarding the issue of lowering MPF fund expenses and the expenditure of MPFA, will the Government inform this Council:</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(1)<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>of the policies put in place by the authorities to tackle the quasi-monopolistic market situation of MPF trustees, for the purpose of urging trustees and fund managers to lower their fund management fees and to enhance their efficiency;</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(2)<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>given that some members of the public have pointed out that the MPF fund investment companies have performed unsatisfactorily and that employees’ contributions have been eroded by the fund management fees charged by them, and a negative rate of return has been recorded for some MPF schemes after deduction of the management fees, whether the authorities will conduct a study on amending the relevant legislation to allow contributors to directly invest, without involving any trustee, their monthly contributions in an amount not less than that required by the law, in index funds of which the management fees are lower (e.g. the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong), with a view to lowering the fund expenses payable by the employees;

all along held that ‘pressure leads to progress’; nowadays, there are many books and discussions available at the market about ‘tiger moms and dads’, ‘helicopter parents’ and ‘monster parents’, etc. for boosting children’s learning, but excessive boosting may likely increase pressure on children and dampen their learning interests; the results of a survey conducted by the Programme for International Student Assessment show that some Hong Kong parents excessively intervene in children’s learning and drill them by being over-anxious for results, rendering a decline of children’s motivation to learn and a negative impact on their academic results; quite a number of media reports have also pointed out that some Hong Kong students have emotional problems because of heavy study pressure, and they become easily anxious and have symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite and irritability, etc.; all these problems are attributable to the education system which emphasizes solely on examination results; at the stage of kindergarten education, parents have already enrolled their children in many types of interest classes and request them to do dictation and spelling exercises, etc.; at the stage of primary education, students need to participate in the Territory-wide System Assessment, the Internal Assessments for Secondary School Places Allocation purpose that take place at the end of Primary Five and both in mid-year and at the end of Primary Six, and the  Pre-Secondary One Hong Kong Attainment Test; at the stage of secondary education, students are faced with a shortage of university places and the  ‘die‍‍ or live’ pressure from the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination; in contrast, the education systems and teaching modes in many advanced places are better able to provide students with room for exploring their interests to enhance their creativity development; in this connection, this Council urges the Administration to:</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(1)<span class="pydocx-tab"> </span>assess afresh the pressure and psychological impact of the existing education system on students, and comprehensively review the examination system, the curriculum contents and the mechanism for progression in education;</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:5.55em">(2)<span class="pydocx-tab">
